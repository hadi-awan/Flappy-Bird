# Flappy-Bird

Created my own version of a flappy-bird game.

Steps:

1) Made a program that drew the bird and made it fall when the mouse was not pressed.
2) Added pipes, and made them move to the left until they hit the left side of the screen. Then reset the pipes to the opposite side.
3) Detected collisions between the bird and the pipes, and forced the game to end when this happens.
4) Added a score. Increased the speed of the pipes as the score increased. 

Extensions:

1) Random pipe separation
2) Pipe details
3) Background Image/Drawing
4) Game over screen
5) Ability to reset the game
6) Wing flap animation
